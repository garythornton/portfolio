## Assignment history

#### Design Lead, IBM Design UK    2007 to date
Since joining IBM Software Group in 2007 I have been the Design Lead for various products in the WebSphere Portfolio, responsible for enhancing the user experience of IBM DataPower, IBM WebSphere Service Registry and Repository, and IBM API Management.


#### Shell Online Portal    01/2004 - 08/2005
Project Description: The Shell Online portal was intended to be the new desktop, giving employees and contractors a view of Shell as a whole enterprise. It is launched automatically when most Shell users start their computers each day and provides targeted access to content, applications and services including other portals.

Project Contribution: I was part of an IBM project team designing and developing Shell's Enterprise Portal based on SAP EP V6 SP9. I was responsible for planning and running a series of global workshops designed to capture user requirements, scenarios and defining the information architecture. In later phases I designed the SAP Portal Theme and conceptual model to be adopted by all subsequent portal developments across Shell. During the development phase I worked closely with a network of content providers across the organisation to ensure a critical mass of content was available for launch. After the pilot I liased with other businesses in Shell to plan how other portals should be accessed from the Enterprise Portal, and how content will be accessed under a role-based Information Architecture.

#### Boots MyStorenet   05/2004 - 08/2004
Project Description: Boots, a leading UK retailer, wanted to extend the reach of its intranet into its stores. MyStoreNet was a personalised Stores Portal that provided key information and applications to store personnel.

Project Contribution: I was engaged as the Lead User Interface Design Consultant. I ran user test sessions to determine the optimal interaction model and provided guidance to the User Interface Designer who was responsible for producing the MyStoreNet UI Specification.

#### O2 Companion   08/2002 - 08/2004      
Project Description: O2 is one of the leading mobile networks in the UK. The O2 Wholesale SMS Shop enabled O2 business customers to register, purchase and configure wholesale SMS products online (www.o2.co.uk), and O2 Retail Gateway enabled O2 stores and O2 resellers to provision mobile phones onto the O2 network.

Project Contribution:  I was been responsible for designing the user experience for several online systems including the O2 Wholesale SMS Shop and O2 Retail Gateway. My responsibilities included gathering the business and user requirements, scenarios and the designing the user experience. I produced detailed UI Specifications which included high level flows and detailed wireframes. These specifications were then used in user testing and by the global development and test teams to build and test the systems.  

#### FT.com  10/2001 - 09/2004      
Project Description: The Financial Times engaged IBM Global Services to help them migrate their free, advertiser-based online publication to a fully re-designed subscription-based service.

Project Contribution: I was a lead designer and creative consultant, co-leading a team of IBM & FT.com designers.   In the early stages of the engagement I worked closely with the FT.com business and marketing teams to gather business and end-user requirements. Then, when the design phase started, I worked with the new Editor-in-Chief of FT.com, and her team, to design the new user interface and subscription conceptual model. Focus groups, organised by the FT.com marketing team, were used to provide feedback from users. The award-winning redesigned site improved navigation, visual presentation, and the ability to locate the quality content the Financial Times is known for.


#### Global Bank Website Redesign  04/2000 - 09/2001        
Project Description:  The brief was to design and build a customisable multi-channel solution that can be used by all of the banks users, globally.

Project Contribution: For this 18 month project I was engaged as the user experience architect and lead user interface design consultant. Travelling regularly between the UK, New York and San Francisco, I lead a design team of 20, including senior UI designers, visual designers, producers and client-side developers. During the first phase of the project I facilitated a series of requirements gathering workshops with the client's management and business representatives. I then produced a prototype to demonstrate the user experience and personalisation principles. The success of this phase lead to IBM Global Services winning a major multi-million dollar contract to partner the bank in leading its extensive global UI design efforts.       

#### Leading European Financial Institution 12/1998 - 11/1999     
Project Description: A major e-business management-consulting engagement for a Swiss bank.

Project Contribution: Based onsite in Zurich and Basel, I was responsible for developing the interaction model, UI and the user experience model. I designed and prototyped a Financial Services Portal to demonstrate account aggregation and advanced personalisation and interaction techniques. I worked closely with the Usability Engineer to plan focus groups, competitive evaluations and usability test sessions in Germany and the UK.  

#### Pamukbank - Online Bank Redesign  07/1998 - 08/1998
Project Description: Pamukbank, the second largest bank in Turkey, called upon IBM Global Services to help them enhance their position in the increasingly competitive Internet Banking Marketplace.

Project Contribution: Based on-site in Istanbul, I started with the analysis of various competitive solutions and made recommendations to the bank's Marketing and IT Executives for re-structuring their existing site using a more user user-driven hierarchy. I then designed the site's look and feel, and produced a set of Pamukbank Internet Design Guidelines.
