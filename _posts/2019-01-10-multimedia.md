## Digital media solutions
When the UK Interactive Media Centre was set up in 1992, I was the first designer in the team, responsible for designing and producing a broad spectrum of digital media solutions including Interactive TV, CD-ROM's, VR and kiosk applications.

Here are just a few of my projects from this period...

### Persil CD-ROM

Lever commissioned IBM e-business to create a multi-lingual, multi-brand pan-European CD-ROM, to be used as a marketing device for Lever’s premium-brand washing powder (Persil, Via, Omo, Skip etc). The CD features advice on clothes-care, a VR ‘washing throughout history’ tour and a game for small children. I was responsible for the UX and visual design.

As Lead Designer on the Vauxhall Astra CD-ROM engagement, I was responsible for the UX and visual design. I art-directed a team of designers, animators and musicians throughout production, and worked closely with the technical team. The CD-ROM was designed to allow the user to experience the features of the New Astra, configure their ideal car, view finance options via the internet, and locate their nearest dealer.

In 1996 Legal & General engaged IBM to create a touch-screen kiosk to introduce potential customers to their products and services, whilst guiding them through the home buying process. I created the 'virtual village' using 3D Studio Max, and later built a SuperScape VR version for inclusion on their web site.

### Vectra

Vauxhall's long e-business relationship with IBM started when I was asked to produce a pilot website featuring the Vauxhall Frontera, based on the 'explore' advertising campaign. Following it's success I created the launch site for the Vectra, based on the 'Technology putting you in control' advertising campaign.
