## IBM Datapower & API Connect

From 2014 to 2016 as Design Lead for IBM DataPower Gateways I was responsible for designing the next generation user experience for the edge gateway appliances. During this time I also worked on several related projects for IBM API Connect, some of which are showcased below.

As the Datapower Design Lead I worked closely with the Offering Managment team, architects and customers to design the next generation user experience for the gateway appliance.

 I shared designs and discussed requirements with customers at the IBM Interconnect conference in Las Vegas during several feedback sessions.

### IBM API Connect 

API Connect is powered by the Datapower gateway so I had various opportunities to work with the API Connect team on various capabilities, including exploring ideas for versioning and user access management.

### IBM API Connect Developer Portal  

The IBM API Connect Developer portal is a Drupal-based site that can be customized by IBM customers to match their brand's design language. I produced the out-of-the box user experience and styling.
