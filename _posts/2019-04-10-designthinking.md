## Enterprise Design Thinking

Enterprise Design Thinking is the framework IBM uses to collaborate, align teams and form intent to solve users’ problems — all while improving customer experiences at the speed and scale the modern enterprise demands.    

I have facilitated/co-facilitated EDT workshops for a variety of clients, business partners and IBM product teams.


### Example EDT Workshop

In October 2015 I flew to Stockholm to co-facilate a week-long EDT workshop for an IBM Analytics team. The following images provide a nice overview of the team's activities and outcome.

After we reviewed the various briefing materials I asked the offering manager to prepare, I kicked off the workshop by introducing Design Thinking. 

The first exercise was to create **Empathy Maps** for the two primary personas...

We then created an **As-is Scenario Map** to identify key pain points...

Next we created **Needs Statements** to address those pain points...

...and prioritised the **Big Ideas** based on the Needs Statements...

We used the Needs Statements and Big Ideas to generate and refine the **Hills**...

The Hills were then used to inspire **storyboards**...

We then co-created and iterated on **paper prototypes**, and used them for **user testing**...

...before producing **hi-fidelity mockups** ready for Playback 0.
