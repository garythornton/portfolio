## IBM App Connect

IBM App Connect is a powerful all-in-one tool for easily connecting apps, integrating data, building APIs and acting on events. I am responsible for the App Connect UX architecture and have led the design of many Hills and capabilities, including the flow editor. In 2017 IBM App Connect won a Spark award for ‘Experience Design’, and in 2018 we won the iF design award.

### An award-winning flow editor for all integration tasks

In 2017 I led the design of the Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) flow editor that can be used by personas covering a broad spectrum of technical abilities and scenarios, ranging from business users who want to quickly automate repetitive tasks, through to integration specialists who want to keep mission critical applications in sync.

Later in 2017 I was awarded an **Outstanding Technical Achievement Award (OTAA)** for the App Connect flow editing experience: 

> *“Gary Thornton designed and delivered a best-in-class flow editing experience that would delight a broad set of user needs along the integration persona Continuum.”*
