## IBM Cloud Integration

The IBM Cloud Integration platform was first launched at IBM Think in March 2018. I produced many of the visual design elements of the landing page...

App Connect is a key capability within the IBM Integration portfolio, and IBM Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I). I work closely with the CP4I designers to ensure App Connect integrates well with the other capabilities, and create end-to-end scenario and UX-topology maps to help align the teams...

Early in 2019 I facilited several design workshops with Design Leads from across the integration portfolio to align key integration patterns, including navigation systems. This in turn led to me working in a cross-portfolio workgroup responsible for aligning navigation systems for all IBM Cloud Paks.
