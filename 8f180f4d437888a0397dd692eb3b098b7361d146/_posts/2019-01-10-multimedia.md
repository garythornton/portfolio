## Digital media solutions
When the UK Interactive Media Centre was set up in 1992, I was the first designer in the team, responsible for designing and producing a broad spectrum of digital media solutions including Interactive TV, CD-ROM's, VR and kiosk applications.

Here are just a few of my projects from this period...

### Persil CD-ROM

Lever commissioned IBM e-business to create a multi-lingual, multi-brand pan-European CD-ROM, to be used as a marketing device for Lever’s premium-brand washing powder (Persil, Via, Omo, Skip etc). The CD features advice on clothes-care, a VR ‘washing throughout history’ tour and a game for small children. I was responsible for the UX and visual design.

As Lead Designer on the Vauxhall Astra CD-ROM engagement, I was responsible for the UX and visual design. I art-directed a team of designers, animators and musicians throughout production, and worked closely with the technical team. The CD-ROM was designed to allow the user to experience the features of the New Astra, configure their ideal car, view finance options via the internet, and locate their nearest dealer.

### Legal & General kiosk

In 1996 Legal & General engaged IBM to create a touch-screen kiosk to introduce potential customers to their products and services, whilst guiding them through the home buying process. I created the 'virtual village' using 3D Studio Max, and later built a SuperScape VR version for inclusion on their web site.

### Vectra

Vauxhall's long e-business relationship with IBM started when I was asked to produce a pilot website featuring the Vauxhall Frontera, based on the 'explore' advertising campaign. Following it's success I created the launch site for the Vectra, based on the 'Technology putting you in control' advertising campaign.
