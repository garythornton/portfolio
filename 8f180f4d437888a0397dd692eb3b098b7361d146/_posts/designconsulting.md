Project Description: In 2001 the Financial Times engaged IBM Global Business Services to help them migrate their free, advertiser-based online publication to a fully re-designed subscription-based service.

Project Contribution: I co-led a team of IBM & FT.com designers. In the early stages of the engagement I worked closely with the FT.com business and marketing teams to gather business and end-user requirements. Then, when the design phase started, I worked with the new Editor-in-Chief of FT.com, and her team, to design the new user interface and subscription conceptual model. Focus groups, organised by the FT.com marketing team, were used to provide feedback from users. After the main contract with IBM ended I was requested back by the Financial Times several times to help introduce new features. 

In 2003 FT.com won the media category of the **New Media Age Effectiveness Awards**. Judges described the site as: 

> *"A monster, the leader of all subscriptions, it sets the standard out there. Head and shoulders above the rest, nothing else could challenge it to first place."*

Project Description: Vodafone UK engaged IBM to re-design their Intranet site.

Project Contribution: Working on-site as part of the consulting team, I was responsible for evaluating the existing intranet and proposing the new information architecture. I performed an expert evaluation of the existing intranet site and facilitated user research sessions that included card-sorting and cognitive walkthroughs; these informed the proposed navigation structure. I then developed high level interaction flows, and the design guidelines.

Project Description: The Shell Online portal was intended to be the new desktop, giving employees and contractors a view of Shell as a whole enterprise.

Project Contribution: I was part of an IBM project team designing and developing Shell's Enterprise Portal based on SAP EP V6 SP9. I was responsible for planning and running a series of global workshops designed to capture user requirements, scenarios and defining the information architecture. In later phases I designed the SAP Portal theme that was to be adopted by all subsequent portal developments across Shell. During the development phase I worked closely with a network of content providers across the organisation to ensure a critical mass of content was available for launch. After the pilot I liased with other businesses in Shell to plan how other portals should be accessed from the Enterprise Portal, and how content would be accessed under a role-based Information Architecture.

Project Description: O2 is one of the leading mobile networks in the UK. The O2 Wholesale SMS Shop enabled O2 business customers to register, purchase and configure wholesale SMS products online, and O2 Retail Gateway enabled O2 stores and O2 resellers to provision mobile phones onto the O2 network.

Project Contribution: In 2002 I was responsible for designing the user experience for several online systems including the O2 Wholesale SMS Shop and O2 Retail Gateway. My responsibilities included gathering the business and user requirements, scenarios and the designing the user experience. I produced detailed UI Specifications which included high level flows and detailed wireframes. These specifications were then used in user testing and by the global development and test teams to build and test the systems.
